# hbl2tid
Boot from the Wii U homebrew launcher into a vWii channel, skipping controller and screen option prompts.

# Usage

1. Grab the `.zip` from the [releases section] and unzip it to the root of your sd card.

2. If you don't want LULZ, OHBC and UNEO you can skip the next step

3. Edit `sd:/wiiu/forwarders/hbl2tid.txt`, in the form of one or multiple lines in the format of "TitleID=TitleName", to change the target channel, or create a menu of target channels.

4. Open hbl2tid in the Homebrew Launcher or open the future channel

***I plan on making a new forwarder channel for this***
